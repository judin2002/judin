Project Description
We target on tracking the cricket ball trajectory and it's future path on a video. It's done using some kind of Machine Learning techniques.

The Problem
Ball tracking system have been already implemented in International matches. Sometimes the fans may gets some doubt that whether the umpire decision was right or wrong. Here come the role of our model. 

The Solution
The user can upload the video if he have. After uploading the model takes some time for it's processing, and gives an output with tracking of ball. Sometimes it may create wrong multiple lines and gives a comment that "It's just a game, and just leave it"
